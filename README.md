# PendingChangesBot

PendingChangesBot is a Django application that inspects pending changes on Wikimedia
projects using the Flagged Revisions API. It fetches the 50 oldest pending pages for a
selected wiki, caches their pending revisions together with editor metadata, and exposes a
Vue.js interface for reviewing the results.

**✨ Now ready for Toolforge deployment!** See [TOOLFORGE_DEPLOYMENT.md](TOOLFORGE_DEPLOYMENT.md) for deployment instructions.

## Installation

1. **Fork the repository**
   - A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original “upstream” repository. Forks are often used to iterate on ideas or changes before they are proposed back to the upstream repository.
   - For more details about how to fork a repository, please check out the [github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) for it.
2. **Clone the repository**
   - Using SSH ([requires setup of ssh keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh))
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Wikimedia-Suomi/PendingChangesBot-ng.git
   cd PendingChangesBot-ng
   ```
   - Using HTTPS
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Wikimedia-Suomi/PendingChangesBot-ng.git
   cd PendingChangesBot-ng
   ```
3. **Check your python version** (recommended)
   - On **Windows**:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
   - On **macOS / Linux**:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```
   Install if not found \*for python3 you need to install pip3
4. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .venv\\Scripts\\activate
   ```
5. **Install Python dependencies**

   - On **Windows**:

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   - On **macOS / Linux**:

   ```bash
   pip3 install --upgrade pip
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Install pre-commit hooks** (recommended for contributors)
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```
   This will automatically format and lint your code before each commit.

### Quick Start for Sublime Text Users
   If you prefer using Sublime Text instead of VS Code:

   - Open the repository folder in Sublime Text.
   - Ensure your virtual environment is activated in the terminal inside Sublime Text.
   - Use the terminal or Sublime's build system to run Django commands, for example:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   You can install Sublime Text packages for Python linting and formatting to complement pre-commit hooks.

   Troubleshooting Tips
   Windows venv activation: If .venv\Scripts\activate doesn't work, try running PowerShell as Administrator or use:
   ```bash
   source .venv/Scripts/activate
   ```

   pip errors: If installing dependencies fails, ensure your pip is upgraded:

   ```bash
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

   Port conflicts: If runserver complains that port 8000 is in use, run:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver 8080
   ```

## Configuring Pywikibot

Pywikibot is used to interact with MediaWiki APIs (FlaggedRevs, page info, etc.).
Statistics data is fetched via direct SQL connections to wiki replica databases
(Superset is no longer used).

1. **Move to app directory**
   All pywikibot and manage.py commands should be run in the app directory.

   ```bash
   cd app
   ```

2. **Create a Pywikibot configuration**

   ```bash
   echo "usernames['meta']['meta'] = 'WIKIMEDIA_USERNAME'" > user-config.py
   ```

3. **Log in with Pywikibot**

   - Using management command

   ```bash
   python manage.py auth_with_username_and_password
   ```


   - On **Windows**:

   ```bash
   python -m pywikibot.scripts.login -site:meta
   ```

   - On **macOS / Linux**:

   ```bash
   python3 -m pywikibot.scripts.login -site:meta
   ```

   The command should report `Logged in on metawiki` and create a persistent login
   cookie at `~/.pywikibot/pywikibot.lwp`.

## Running the database migrations

```bash
cd app
```

On **Windows**:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

- On **macOS / Linux**:

```bash
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```

## Running the application

The Django project serves both the API and the Vue.js frontend from the same codebase.

```bash
cd app
```

- On **Windows**:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

- On **macOS / Linux**:

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8000/> in your browser to use the interface. JSON endpoints are
available under `/api/wikis/<wiki_id>/…`, for example `/api/wikis/1/pending/`.

### API Documentation

Interactive API documentation is available via Swagger UI:

- **Swagger UI**: <http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/> - Interactive API explorer
- **ReDoc**: <http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc/> - Alternative documentation view

For detailed API documentation, see [docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md](docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md).

### Statistics

The application includes statistics functionality that tracks FlaggedRevs data and reviewer activity using direct SQL access to wiki replica databases.

**Features:**
- Monthly aggregates (total pages, reviewed pages, pending lag)
- Reviewer activity metrics
- Individual review records with delay calculations
- Interactive charts and visualizations

**Loading Statistics:**
```bash
# Load FlaggedRevs statistics for Finnish Wikipedia
TOOLFORGE_DEPLOYMENT=true python manage.py load_flaggedrevs_statistics_direct_sql --wiki fi

# Load individual review records
TOOLFORGE_DEPLOYMENT=true python manage.py load_review_statistics_direct_sql --wiki fi --limit 10000
```

For detailed documentation on the statistics implementation, see [docs/DIRECT_SQL_STATISTICS.md](docs/DIRECT_SQL_STATISTICS.md).

## Running unit tests

Unit tests live in the Django backend project. Run them from the `app/` directory so Django can locate the correct settings module.

```bash
cd app
```

- On **Windows**:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

- On **macOS / Linux**:

```bash
python3 manage.py test
```

## Code Coverage

Run tests with coverage measurement:

```bash
cd app
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
```

View coverage report in terminal:

```bash
coverage report
```

Generate and view HTML coverage report:

```bash
coverage html
open htmlcov/index.html  # On macOS
# Or navigate to htmlcov/index.html in your browser
```

## Code Quality & Security

This project uses automated checks to catch bugs and security issues before they reach production.

### Tools

- **mypy** - Type checking to catch type errors before runtime
- **Ruff (Bandit rules)** - Security scanning for common vulnerabilities
- **pip-audit** - Dependency vulnerability scanning

All checks run automatically in CI on every PR. You can also run them locally for faster feedback.

### Running Checks Locally (Optional)

**Option 1: Run all checks at once**
```bash
./scripts/run-checks.sh
```

**Option 2: Run individually**
```bash
# Type checking
cd app && python -m mypy reviews --config-file=../pyproject.toml

# Security scanning
python -m ruff check --select S app/

# Dependency scanning
python -m pip_audit -r requirements.txt
```

The CI will run these same checks on every PR.

## Code Formatting and Linting

This project uses [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for code formatting and linting.

**Note:** If you installed pre-commit hooks (step 6 above), formatting and linting happen automatically before each commit. You don't need to run these commands manually.

### Manual Commands

```bash
# Format code
ruff format app/

# Check and fix linting issues
ruff check app/ --fix
```

If you are working inside a virtual environment, ensure it is activated before executing the command.
